# mathproblem
This is just a simple code that describes a simple, yet imposible, 3x + 1 problem.
It shows how many iterations would it take to get to the infinite loop of 1 and 4 for the entered number;
For example, initial number is 5, if it is odd it multiplies by 3 and 1 is added. If it is even, it is than divided by 2.
So, 5 multiplied by 3 is 15, add 1, and the result is 16. That is one iteration.
16 is even, divide by 2, and the result is 8. That is the second iteration.
8 is even, divide by 2, result: 4. Third iteration.
4 divided by 2 is 2. Fourth iteration.
2 divided by 2 is 1. Fifth iteration.
So it takes 5 iterations to get to 1. 1 is odd, if we continue with the function we stumble upon an infinite loop.
1 is odd, multiplied by 3 is 3, add 1, and the result is 4.
4 divided by 2 is 2.
2 divided by 2 is 1... And so on.
